### Step 2 - STYLES

Change the color theme of the website - (choose 2 colors to create a gradient)

Go to `/src/sass/abstracts/_variables.scss` and only change the values for this variables `$main-color` and `$secondary-color` with your prefered HEX color.
If you want to get some gradients inspiration I highly recommend you to check this website [UI Gradient](https://uigradients.com/#BrightVault)
